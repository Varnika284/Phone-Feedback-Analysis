# Phone-Feedback-Analysis

# Phone Feedback Analysis Using NLP
This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on analyzing phone feedback data. The project leverages NLP techniques to extract insights from customer feedback, helping to understand user sentiments, common issues, and general satisfaction.

# Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:
Preprocessing text data to make it suitable for analysis.
Conducting sentiment analysis to gauge customer emotions.
Extracting key themes or topics from feedback.
Visualizing feedback trends and common terms to highlight customer concerns and preferences.

# Notebook Contents
The notebook file, Phone Feedback analysis NLP.ipynb, includes the following sections:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data (e.g., removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization).
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing the sentiment of the feedback to categorize it as positive, negative, or neutral.
Topic Modeling: Identifying common topics or themes within the feedback.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations like word clouds and sentiment distribution charts to illustrate feedback insights.

# Requirements
To run the notebook, youâ€™ll need:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
NLP libraries (e.g., nltk, spacy, sklearn)
Visualization libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud)

# Usage
Open Phone Feedback analysis NLP.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run the cells sequentially to see the data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps.
